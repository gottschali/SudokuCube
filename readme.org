* Observations
** Direction
It does not matter if you start from the "end" or the "start" of the sequence
** Starting points
*** Symmetry
There are 4 distinct starting points
- Middle (of the entire cube)
- Center (of a face)
- Edge
- Corner
*** Optimisation
With checkboard coloring one can see that there are
15 "white" and 14 "black" cubelets. Every step it changes color.
Therefore it must start on a "white" which is wlog a center

** Bipartite check
If the search divides the cube in more than one free region it is impossible to coplete it.
This can be checked with a depth first search which improves the required steps though it runs slower.

* Coloring Analysis
** Faces
How many faces are served with a cubelet of type
- Middle -> 0
- Center -> 1
- Edge -> 2
- Corner -> 3
** Combination of triplets
- middle cornern corner
- Edge Edge Edge
- Corner Center Center

* Result
- There are 2 Solution for the canonical sequence

* Further questions
** Find a mathematical proof that does not rely on brute force
** How to construct valid sequences
** How many valid sequences are there
** Can this be generalized to other cube sizes
